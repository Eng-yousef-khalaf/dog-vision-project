# ## üê∂ End-to-end Multil-class Dog Breed Classification
# 
# This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.x and TensorFlow Hub.
# ###1. Problem
# 
# Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.
# 
# When I'm sitting at the cafe and I take a photo of a dog, I want to know what breed of dog it is.
# ###2. Data
# 
# The data we're using is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition.
# 
# https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data
# ###3. Evaluation
# 
# The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.
# 
# https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview/evaluation
# ###4. Features
# 
# Some information about the data:
# 
#    * We're dealing with images (unstructured data) so it's probably best we use deep learning/transfer learning.
#    * There are 120 breeds of dogs (this means there are 120 different classes).
#    * There are around 10,000+ images in the training set (these images have labels).
#    * There are around 10,000+ images in the test set (these images have no labels, because we'll want to predict them).
#

# To preprocess our images into Tensors we're going to write a function which does a few things:

# * 3- Turn our 'image' (a jpg) into Tensors
# * 4- Normalize our image (convert color channel values from from 0-255 to 0-1).
# * 5- Resize the 'image' to be a shape of (224, 224)
# * 6- Return the modified 'image'

# Before we do, let's see what importing an image looks like.

# ## Building a model
# 
# Before we build a model, there are a few things we need to define:
# 
#    * The input shape (our images shape, in the form of Tensors) to our model.
#    * The output shape (image labels, in the form of Tensors) of our model.
#    * The URL of the model we want to use from TensorFlow Hub - https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/4
# 
# 

# In[48]:


IMG_SIZE


# In[49]:


# Setup input shape to the model
INPUT_SHAPE = [None, IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE, 3]

# Setup input shape to the model
OUTPUT_SHAPE = len(unique_breeds)

# Setup model URL from TensorFlow Hub

MODEL_URL = "https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/mobilenet-v2/TensorFlow2/130-224-classification/2"


# Now we've got our inputs, outputs and model ready to go. Let's put them together into a Keras deep learning model!
# 
# Knowing this, let's create a function which:
# 
#    * Takes the input shape, output shape and the model we've chosen as parameters.
#    * Defines the layers in a Keras model in sequential fashion (do this first, then this, then that).
#    * Compiles the model (says it should be evaluated and improved).
#    * Builds the model (tells the model the input shape it'll be getting).
#     Returns the model.
# 
# All of these steps can be found here: https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/overview

# ## Creating callbacks
# 
# Callbacks are helper functions a model can use during training to do such things as save its progress, check its progress or stop training early if a model stops improving.
# 
# We'll create two callbacks, one for TensorBoard which helps track our models progress and another for early stopping which prevents our model from training for too long.
# 
# ### TensorBoard Callback
# 
# To setup a TensorBoard callback, we need to do 3 things:
# 1. Load the TensorBoard notebook extension ‚úÖ
# 2. Create a TensorBoard callback which is able to save logs to a directory and pass it to our model's `fit()` function. ‚úÖ
# 3. Visualize our models training logs with the `%tensorboard` magic function (we'll do this after model training).
# 
# https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/TensorBoard

                        datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S"))
  return tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(logdir)


# ### Early Stopping Callback
# 
# Early stopping helps stop our model from overfitting by stopping training if a certain evaluation metric stops improving.
#

# In[56]:

# Let's create a function which trains a model.
# 
# * Create a model using `create_model()`
# * Setup a TensorBoard callback using `create_tensorboard_callback()`
# * Call the `fit()` function on our model passing it the training data, validation data, number of epochs to train for (`NUM_EPOCHS`) and the callbacks we'd like to use
# * Return the model

# 
# **Note:** Overfitting to begin with is a good thing! It means our model is learning!!!

# ## Making predictions on the test dataset
# 
# Since our model has been trained on images in the form of Tensor batches, to make predictions on the test data, we'll have to get it into the same format.
# 
# Luckily we created `create_data_batches()` earlier which can take a list of filenames as input and conver them into Tensor batches.
# 
# To make predictions on the test data, we'll:
# * Get the test image filenames. ‚úÖ
# * Convert the filenames into test data batches using `create_data_batches()` and setting the `test_data` parameter to `True` (since the test data doesn't have labels). ‚úÖ
# * Make a predictions array by passing the test batches to the `predict()` method called on our model.

# In[88]:


# Load test image filenames

# Create test data batch
test_data = create_data_batch(test_filename, test_data=True)

# **Note:** Calling `predict()` on our full model and passing it the test data batch will take a long time to run (about a ~1hr). This is because we have to process ~10,000+ images and get our model to find patterns in those images and generate predictions based on what its learned in the training dataset.

# In[93]:


# Make predictions on test data batch using the loaded full model

# ## Preparing test dataset predictions for Kaggle
# 
# Looking at the Kaggle sample submission, we find that it wants our models prediction probaiblity outputs in a DataFrame with an ID and a column for each different dog breed.
# https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview/evaluation
# 
# To get the data in this format, we'll:
# * Create a pandas DataFrame with an ID column as well as a column for each dog breed. ‚úÖ
# * Add data to the ID column by extracting the test image ID's from their filepaths.
# * Add data (the prediction probabilites) to each of the dog breed columns.
# * Export the DataFrame as a CSV to submit it to Kaggle.

# ## Making predictions on custom images
# 
# To make predictions on custom images, we'll:
# * Get the filepaths of our own images.
